Building products and startups at [Cofounders.sg](http://www.cofounders.sg/), I spend a fair amount of time talking to entrepreneurs about their ideas to change the world. This is really exciting. Red flags are raised, however, by those who propose **Non-Disclosure Agreements** even before the first meeting. These are often poorly worded documents, frightening to read, come with a variety of threats and restrictions, and offer nothing in return except the vague promise of some idea that is *oh-so-sure* to succeed.

It's amazing that in a time of Lean Startup openness and collaboration some entrepreneurs still try to cover up what they are working on.

As a rule I always reject NDAs or similar restrictions at this early stage. There are non-disclosure clauses in our project agreement with clients, but that covers the work done during projects, not the startup's initial ideas and unproven hypotheses.

There are several ressons to reject NDAs:

1. **NDAs do not create value.** Startups are in the business of creating value for investors and customers. When is the last time you heard a startup pitch the number of NDAs they signed? Successful entrepreneurs spend their time on more important things.

1. **NDAs increase risk.** The nature of Cofounders.sg exposes it to many creative entrepreneurs with an immense variety of ideas, but sometimes overlapping. I avoid NDAs to protect the interests of Cofounders.sg, its clients, and other entrepreneurs by keeping preliminary discussions free and open. When working on a client project I can not afford to have to work around the nuances of a similar idea discussed with a different entrepreneur. Vice versa, I share insights with entrepreneurs who should not be liable if they incorporated our suggestions into their startup.

1. **NDAs are expensive.** It would cost a small fortune to have every NDA vetted by a qualified lawyer. Even with a standardised NDA, this burden would fall on every entrepreneur I talk to. As a lean startup, controlling legal expenses increases your [runway](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/12/burn-rate.html).

1. **NDAs are slow.** Doing the *NDA dance* before even discussing an idea is too much overhead. It often takes more time to debate the legalese of NDAs than for an entrepreneur to explain their idea.

## Sharing Makes it More Attractive

Perhaps the strongest validation for an idea is to have others duplicate it. So if you really want to impress investors and co-founders, go out and try to get people to copy-cat you before you even launch. It's a lot harder than it sounds.

## <s>Practice</s> Iteration Makes Perfect

An entrepreneur who is afraid to share their ideas *probably doesn't have a well thought out idea yet*. Sharing ideas is a cheap and effective way to get early feedback from potential customers, cofounders, mentors, and investors. This allows ideas to fail faster and pivot with less wasted time and resources.

My advice to entrepreneurs is to pitch their idea as early as possible at startup-related meetups, talk to developers and designers to get their feedback, and do customer development to prove your hypotheses. All of these will hone the idea into something more valuable for free.
