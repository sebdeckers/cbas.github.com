I like to think of developers as craftsmen, because we pay so much attention to the tools of our trade. [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) has become one of the most important tools that I use for frontend development as of late.

I've used Grunt for several projects in the last year or so. Recently I took a deep dive into creating my own Grunt plugins, and contributed patches to a few `grunt-contrib` and [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) repos. So I shared some of my experience at the recent [Front-end Developers User Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/frontendsingapore/) in Singapore.
