I'd been meaning to set up a generated static site hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/), deployed by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and written in [Markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/) using [Prose](http://prose.io/).

Buying a sweet little domain, [ninja.sg](http://ninja.sg/), was the push I needed to set up a new blog. Finally I can sunset [my abandoned Blogspot](http://cbas.pandion.im/).

I'm looking forward to posting wild, ferocious rants on a more publically embarrassing place than Facebook.
