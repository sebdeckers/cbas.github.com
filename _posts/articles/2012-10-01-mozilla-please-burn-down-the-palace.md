Retina display support took 4 weeks to land in Chrome Stable build. Firefox still doesn't have it in a Nightly build after 4 months. It pains me to see Mozilla faltering in recent years after accomplishing so much.

## Four years ago was the golden age of Firefox.

The open source browser was eating away at Internet Explorer's market share, month by month. Web developers adored its state-of-the-art rendering engine, Javascript performance, and Firebug IDE. Users loved its add-ons to block advertising.

## Then Chrome happened.

Leveraging Apple's Webkit engine, Chrome quickly caught up to Firefox. Not stifled by an existing user base, Google was able to avoid bloated features and rethink the browser's user interface. The collaboration between engineers from many different companies allowed new ideas to flourish and compete for developer mindshare. The collaboration also guaranteed better code quality through a review process by neutral committers.

Fast forward to today: Mozilla's power users, the web developers and techies, have largely moved to Chrome. Building sites that work in Firefox is an afterthought at best, a nuissance like Internet Explorer support. Its market share is [trending downwards](http://i.imgur.com/6MkPJ.jpg) ([source](http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-monthly-200807-201209)).

## Now Mozilla Foundation is the Versailles

The Mozilla Foundation still enjoys record revenues thanks to a lucrative advertising deal with Google. It's guaranteed to bring in $300 million annually until November 2014.

French King Louis XIV created the palace of Versailles to keep the aristocrats busy with parties and frivolities to drain their pockets. The same happened at Mozilla.

Google's money has transformed the Mozilla developer community into managers, strategists, marketers, and other non-browser-building types. They love throwing money at [vacuous parties to "celebrate learning"](http://mozillafestival.org/) and [jet-setting with the trendy startup crowd](https://webfwd.org/). I've seen more Mozilla people at socialising events in Singapore's incubators than I've interacted with on GitHub. Where once you'd often land on a raw Bugzilla ticket page, talking directly to code committers, now you're more likely to find fancy "do-gooder" graphics and cleverly written copy on Mozilla's marketing mini-sites.

## Mozilla, Please Burn Down the Palace and Rebuild the Community

With some historic perspective there is hope for improvement. The history of Mozilla is one of voluntary death and rebirth. From Netscape to Mozilla to Firefox. Each time the browser became bloated and out of touch. Each time hackers did the hard work that needed to be done.

It's time for a fork of Firefox. Get it up on Git. Ditch Bugzilla. Cut away the fat. Rebuild a lean browser to fight Google's privacy-crushing Chrome browser.
